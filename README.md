let pair = PairName::from("BTC", "USD");
let req = client.get_ohlc_data(&pair).interval(Interval::Day1);
let resp = req.send().await;

println!("{:?}", resp);

let pair = "XXRPZUSD";
let resp = client
    .add_limit_order(pair, OrderSide::Buy, "20", "0.10")
    .expire_after(60 * 60)
    .userref(123)
    .validate_only()
